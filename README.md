# pandas-challenge-1

Please find my assignment. The instructor gave me permission to turn it in a day late.

Full discolsure - I consulted ChatGPT for minor assistance when I hit a wall.

However, I used it a bit more extensively in Part IV, particularly on the first problem:
("# How much did each of the top 5 clients by quantity spend? Check your work from Part 1 for client ids
need to group by client_id, qty, then multiply qty*unit_price, sort descending")

and last:
("Rename the columns to reflect the change in the money format. ")
